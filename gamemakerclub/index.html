<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>The Game Maker Club at RM high school was founded by Josiah (TheWatermelonMan3) and four friends (DK, KK, JS, NJ). <br>
  Current leadership includes all founders as well as two other leaders (KS, SM). <br>
  In the 2023-2024 school year we created the project "Lockdown in Cell Block Nine," a board game influenced by video game mechanics, over a semester. <br>
  Initial plans were to self-publish the game, put publication was put to an end as key team members became busy with other projects. <br>
  In the 2024-2025 school year, club game development projects are on hiatus until club leadership have finished college applications. <br>
  This year was focused more on game discussion, play sessions, and critique. <br>
  One project the team did finish was making a game in 1 hour, which you can play <a href = "https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1070074616/" class = "a3" target = "_blank">here ↗</a>.

<h2>Lockdown in Cell Block Nine</h2>
<p>In the 2023-2024 school year, Game Maker Club prototyped an all-original board game entitled "Lockdown in Cell Block Nine." <br>
  It's a goofy game about escaping from prison. Players compete to be the fastest one out of the jail using ridiculous methods like digging tunnels with spoons. <br>
  The core development team was myself and DK, KK, JS, NJ, KS, and SM. <br>
  A central mechanic of the game is the automated camera system which turns security cameras on at regular intervals, allowing prisoners to be caught if they don't time their moves
  with the correct turn. Also important is the random guard spawning system which assigns guards to check on a subset of spaces on the board, and if they find prisoners, to catch them.
