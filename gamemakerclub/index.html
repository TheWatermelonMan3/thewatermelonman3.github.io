<h1>Game Maker Club</h1>
<p>The Game Maker Club at RM high school was founded by Josiah (TheWatermelonMan3) and four friends (DK, KK, JS, NJ). <br>
  Current leadership includes all founders as well as two other leaders (KS, SM). <br>
  In the 2023-2024 school year we created the project "Lockdown in Cell Block 9," a board game influenced by video game mechanics, over a semester. <br>
  Initial plans were to self-publish the game, put publication was put to an end as key team members became busy with other projects. <br>
  In the 2024-2025 school year, club game development projects are on hiatus until club leadership have finished college applications. <br>
  This year was focused more on game discussion, play sessions, and critique. <br>
  One project the team did finish was making a game in 1 hour, which you can play <a href = "https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1070074616/" class = "a3" target = "_blank">here â†—</a>.
